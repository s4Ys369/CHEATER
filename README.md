## How to add cheats/mods
 * Use `src/game/mario_cheats.c` for code
   - each of the `actions` files has a single line function
   - Use with `mario_cheats.h` to add new functionality
 * Use `src/game/cheats_menu.h` for in game options
   - add `TEXT_OPT_<NAME>` to `optsCheatsStr`
   - if using a list, you need to make an array for `TEXT_OPT`
     as well as one for the strings (see file for example)
 * Use `include/text_cheats_strings.h.in` to tell the game what to print
   - ie `#define TEXT_OPT_HEY _("Hey")`
   - should be done for both JP and US
   - JP only uses capital letters
   - In game buttons examples `_("[A]")` or `_("[C]<")` no L though
 * Use `src/game/options_menu.c` to add to `static struct Option optCheats`
 * If adding new files, the `Makefile` will most likely need to be edited
   - External Data aka `build/res/base.zip` is handled partly in both the `Makefile` and `Makefile.split`
